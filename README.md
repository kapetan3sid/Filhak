# RFP Proposal: Filhak - FVM Development Environment

**Name of Project:** Filhak 

**Proposal Category:** `devtools-libraries`

**Proposer:** `@thedivic`

Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT, GPL, and APACHE2 licenses?: `Yes`

## Project Description

### Filhak 
(`>$ filhak)` is (*supposed to be*) a filecoin development environment heavily influenced by [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

It allows FVM developers to:

- Easily launch a (stripped-down) local devnet Filecoin node (+FVM), with no setup required
- Use one or more **Go** packages that implement helper functions used in scripting **tasks** that are common to actor development (deploying and calling actors, creating & funding accounts, working with deals and the retrieval market etc)
- Use the task runner (similar to Hardhat Runner) that is used to run your Go tasks
- Use tools and helpers to write and run **integration tests** **that interact** with the local **Filhak** devnet to test your actors.
- Deploy your custom actors to the testnet and mainnet.

### Motivation

After our research of the existing **EVM** tooling we realized how extensive and well rounded SDKs, libraries and plugins are. Even though there are some more "advanced" environments based on **WASM**, it was quite obvious to us why **EVM** is currently most utilized in blockchain and why it is so easy to build on it. 

Above all other **EVM** tools stand:

**Hardhat** - A one stop sandbox where developers are able to compile, deploy, test, and debug EVM smart contracts. 

We believe that sandbox similar to **Hardhat** would be highly valuable for developers that want to explore **FVM** and would greatly ease the building process.

## Features in-depth

### Filhak init

`>$ filhak init [path]`

Initializes a filhak project in the given directory.

Creates a `filhak.toml` configuration file, sets up the default file and directory structure, fetches **Go** modules etc.

### Filhak network

`>$ filhak node --port 8765`

**Filhak network** is a (stripped-down) local development network for Filecoin that works out of the box, with no setup required.

Every filhak task is executed inside the local filhak network.

The idea is to bootstrap and connect one lotus client and miner node and run them in the background.

Nodes should be headless and stripped down of all of the features that are unnecessary for local development but are required to operate a full lotus node, to improve performance and optimize the development experience. 

The network can be exposed for external JSON-RPC calls by running  `>$ filhak node` (if necessary).

‚ö†Ô∏è¬† This assumes that lotus will integrate with FVM and at least built-in FVM actors (we can use a development version if it‚Äôs available, before launching to mainnet).

### Filhak Go package

`import "github.com/Bloxico/filhak/script"`

Filhak provides one or more **Go packages** that implement common helper functions & data structures used in writing filhak tasks during actor development.

Stuff like:

- Creating and funding accounts
- Creating and sending transactions
- Creating and interacting with deals
- Working with the retrieval market
- Interacting with deployed (or built-in) actors
- Reading the (devnet) chain state tree
- etc

These helper functions should be optimized for **developer experience,** and hide underlying complexity of instantiating big Lotus data structures and making multiple API calls.

### Filhak scripts

`>$ filhak run script.go [--task=<name>]` 

Runs a script file on the local development network.

Given the task parameter, it executes a single task from the file.

Tasks are simple go functions:

```go
func DeployActorTask(ctx Context, fh *filhak.Network) { ... }
```

Positional parameters can be passed to tasks via the run command, and accessed inside the task code

```go
func FundAccountTask(ctx Context, fh *filhak.Network) {
	amount := ctx.args[0]
	addr := ctx.args[1]
  fh.Accounts.Fund(addr, amount)
}
```

### Filhak testing

`import "github.com/Bloxico/filhak/testing"`

Filhak uses `go test` to run tests and provides helper functions for interacting with the filhak network and the deployed and built-in actors.

It also provides a set of filecoin-specific assertions that can be used in your tests.

### Filhak templates

`>$ filhak template <template_name> [--name=<local_name>]` 

You can use filhak to instantiate actors from existing best-practice, reviewed actor templates implemented by other builders
or by PL developers (inspired by OpenZeppelin contracts).
Templated actors then can be further extended with additional business logic.

The repository that holds these contracts will be determined in sync with other early builders and PL developers and filhak will pull the templates from that repo and instantiate them locally.

## Milestones and deliverables


### Milestone 1 - Filhak Network

**Deliverables:**

- `filhak` CLI tool
- project scaffolding and configuration 
- launch and interact with the development network via `filhak node` command

**Funding for this milestone:**

+ 38.000,00 $

For M1 two full time **Go** developers will be employed

**Estimated Milestone Delivery:**
End of July 2022

### Milestone 2 - Filhak Scripting

**Deliverables:**

- run filhak scripts via the `filhak run script.go [--task=<name>]` command on the local devnet
- implement the `github.com/Bloxico/filhak/script` helper package
- interact with locally deployed actors in scripts using the helper functions

**Funding for this milestone:**

+ 40.000,00 $

For M1 two full time **Go** developers will be employed

**Estimated Milestone Delivery:**
End of September 2022

### Milestone 3 - Filhak Testing

- run filhak (integration) tests via the `filhak test` command on the local devnet
- implement the `github.com/Bloxico/filhak/test` helper package

**Funding for this milestone:**

+ 35.000,00 $

For M1 two full time **Go** developers will be employed

**Estimated Milestone Delivery:**
End of November 2022

### Milestone 4 - Templates & developer experience improvements

- instantiate common actors from best-practice templates via the `filhak template` command
- work with other early builders on structuring and populating the best-practice actor repository
- test filhak on existing 3rd party actors, look for feedback and possible developer experience improvements

**Funding for this milestone:**

+ 41.000,00 $

For M1 two full time **Go** developers will be employed.


**Estimated Milestone Delivery:**
End of January 2023

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We plan on maintaining our existing codebase as well as to develop and integrate additional features such as: 

- Actor deployment on Testnet and Mainnet as soon as it's available
- Implement a VS Code extension for filhak to improve the dev experience

‚ö†Ô∏è Some of these future features depend on FVM delivery.

üöÄ **Moonshot**: Our end goal is to develop "Filecoin Simulation" similar to what **Ganache** is offering, where developers will be able to quickly fire up a personal **Filecoin** blockchain which they can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates. But this is a long-shot and way out of scope for this proposal.

## Project Requirements

- User programmability (3rd party actors) are required for filhak to reach it‚Äôs full potential. 
- Feedback from other early builders and PL developers is highly recommended, so we can improve the development experience of our framework

## Relevant Experience 

Our team have extensive experience in regards to writting in **Go** as well as experiance with **Filecoin** technology. We have successfuly developed:
- **System Test Matrix** - Lotus Filecoin test coverage improvement and visualization dashboard.

And currently we are developing first phase of:
- **Testground** -  platform for testing, benchmarking, and simulating distributed and p2p systems at scale infrastructure and software revamp.

Furthermore, we followed the FVM development since its inception. We  participated in various **FVM AMA** sessions as well as recurring **FVM Early Builders Check In** where we indicated that we would like to to develop **Hardhat** inspired development enviroment for **FVM**
